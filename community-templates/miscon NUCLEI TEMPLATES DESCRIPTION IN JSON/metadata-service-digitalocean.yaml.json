"vulnerability_type":"metadata-service-digitalocean",
"vulnerability_severity":"critical",
"vulnerability_description":"The DigitalOcean host is configured as a proxy which allows access to the instance metadata service. This could allow significant access to the host/infrastructure",
"vulnerability_remediation":"Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible",
"impact":"This attack abuses a misconfigured proxy that allows access to the metadata IP or a name which resolves to the IP. A standard proxy request is made to the proxy using the full metadata URL, which the proxy will fulfill to its own metadata service.The proxy may also be vulnerable to host/port enumeration on localhost or inside the private network."
